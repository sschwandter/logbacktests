Run Main.class once with root logger level set to INFO. I got around 0.1s on my system
Then set level to DEBUG - on my system it took 4s.

It might be not much in absolute terms, but it's still an around 40x slow down.
It gets a bit better if there are no string substitutions, but still 3+ seconds.
